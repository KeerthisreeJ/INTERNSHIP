# INTERNSHIP
This repository contains the codes I've developed during my various internships. Each script and module represents a different project or task that I've worked on, showcasing the skills and knowledge I've gained throughout these experiences. The projects span a range of topics, including data loading, processing, machine learning model training, evaluation, and visualization, all of which contribute to solving real-world problems encountered during my internships.
